In this presentation I will visualize the Yelp Dataset using Vega-lite framework. 

The Yelp dataset has following data files:
1. yelp_business.csv
1. yelp_business_attributes.csv
1. yelp_business_hours.csv
1. yelp_checkin.csv
1. yelp_photos.csv
1. yelp_reviews.csv
1. yelp_tip.csv

As the dataset is huge with many files, we will mostly use the first two files for our visualization.

1. <p class="fragment highlight-blue">yelp_business.csv</p>
1. <p class="fragment highlight-red">yelp_business_attributes.csv</p>

---

I will analyze the businesses based on their following properties:

* Ratings
* Cities
* States

<p class="fragment">Lets begin with **Ratings.**</p>
